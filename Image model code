To do : 
(In this code, replace 'my_trained_model.h5' and 'path_to_your_test_image.jpg' with your model's filename and path to the image you want to predict respectively. This code loads an image, preprocesses it, and feeds it to the model to get nutrition predictions. Then, it stores these predictions as a dictionary in a human-readable form.

Please note that, to create such a model that predicts all nutritional measures you will need a complex architecture and a dataset that includes these nutritional measures for each food image. Your model should be able to output multiple numeric values corresponding to these nutritional measures.
    
    return nutrition_info
